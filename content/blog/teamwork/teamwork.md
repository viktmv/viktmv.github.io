People are social creatures.   

We were never meant to do things alone. One can think and invent on their own, but to create and
produce something of value to humanity - takes a team effort. Since our hunter-gatherer days,
we organized ourselves in tribes and families to be more productive and to increase our chances of survival.  

Old rules still apply - lonely loner cannot accomplish much even today.  

Sure, we have major figures that are famous and great and all, but underneath their success there's always
people they depend on. There are teams who work hard to help bring this person where they are.  

Same applies to programming industry. Lone developer, be they 10x, rockstar, or ninja, cannot make a significant
impact on company's progress or industry development unless supported by peers, colleagues or team members.
This is why, we as an industry should make sure we encourage development of soft skills, and bring people with those skills to programming. Kindness, communication, writing, clear thinking - combined with some tech domain knowledge these are the skills that will catapult forward the next big thing.

The times for jerk-geniuses has passed.
