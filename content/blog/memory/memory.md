Human memory is short.  

People tend to forget rather quickly. Time goes by, old things are forgotten, old mistakes are buried, old ideas don’t really matter anymore.  

This leads to two observations:  

First, we quickly forget lies, mistakes that cost lives, and very often bad deeds go unpunished	 and without consequences for crimes committed.  

On the other hand, since mistakes are also forgotten, it gives you freedom to try and fail again.  
Even catastrophic mistakes don’t really matter that much in the long term. Life goes on, time marches forward.  

Since we as a society have a very short memory, you can use it to try things.  
I’m not saying go out and do crazy shit, just that if you’re afraid to do something because you’re thinking “what would people say if I fail” - don’t worry, they’ll forget all about you in a bit of time.  

Dare to try - don’t be afraid.
