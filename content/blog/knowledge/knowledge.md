Knowledge

Intellectuals of the past had an opportunity to memorize knowledge. It was important to be an erudite if you wanted to be smart.

Mostly not the case today. Today, sheer amount of things to know is too huge. The knowledge horizon is constantly expanding, and it has long passed the point where it was feasible to keep most of ideas in your head. Now, to be effective in this new world, you need to know not the idea/concept/formula itself, but of its existence and location. If it exists and where to find it. Sort of like keep a reference in your head instead of keeping the whole thing.  

Of course, the old-school knowledge-based intellectuals still exist, but it largely remains this way in highly specialized fields of knowledge, like sciences.

Itâ€™s not possible to know everything.
