TC-39 released a [new version](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/releases/tag/es2020) of ECMAScript on July 17th 2020.  
That means JavaScript just got a bunch of new shiny things in its official specification.  

Here's a list of what got added this year:
* String.prototype.matchAll
* import()
* BigInt
* Promise.allSettled
* globalThis
* updated for-in mechanics
* Optional Chaining
* Nullish coalescing Operator
* import.meta

Let's take a closer look at each of these ðŸ‘€

## [String.prototype.matchAll](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-string-matchall)
Introduces ability to capture all matches in a string using RegExp groups. 
The way to do this before was to use _RegExp.exec_ method plus some iteration.

Let's look at an example of using _String.prototype.match_ vs _String.prototype.matchAll_.
  
We start by setting up a string and a pattern:
```j
let weather = `
  weather in Toronto is 21 degrees, nice and sunny; 
  weather in London is 18 degrees, rainy;
`
let pattern = /weather\sin\s([A-Z]\w+)[^;]+(\d\d)[^;]*,([^;]*);/g
```

Now let's try to match it using _String.prototype.match_
```j
weather.match(pattern) 
// This will give us:
[ 
  "weather in Toronto is 21 degrees, nice and sunny;",
  "weather in London is 18 degrees, rainy;" 
]  
```

Now let's do the same thing using _String.prototype.matchAll_.  
_matchAll_ returns an [iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterator_protocol) object which we can iterate over or convert to an array.  

We can use [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) to covert it into an array.
```j
â€¨[...weather.matchAll(pattern)]
// This will give us:
[
  [
    "weather in Toronto is 21 degrees, nice and sunny;",
    "Toronto",
    "21",
    " nice and sunny"
  ],
  [
    "weather in London is 18 degrees, rainy;",
    "London",
    "18",
    " rainy"
  ]
]
```


So, in the end we can do something like (contrived example but still quite fun)
```j
let [weatherInToronto, weatherInLondon] = [...weather.matchAll(pattern)]
let [_, city, degrees, description] = weatherInToronto

console.log(city) // Toronto
console.log(degrees) // 21
console.log(description) // 'nice and sunny'
```

Overall, Regular Expressions are extremely powerful and you can do **A LOT** with them, especially using [Groups and Ranges](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Groups_and_Ranges). And this proposal makes string matching even more useful.

## [Dynamic import](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import)
'function-like' imports made their way to JavaScript. Introduced to dynamically load parts of JS application at runtime.  
 
You use it by calling it with module specifier - _import(module)_, where _module_ can be an expression (and it will be evaluated). 
We can dynamically load different modules depending on some other conditions, for example: 
```j
import(`./language-packs/${navigator.language}.js`)
```

Dynamic import returns a _Promise_, so it can be used in _async/await_ flow.

Example usage with loading a module on button click:
```html
<button onclick="import('./foo.mjs')">Click me</button>
```

Other examples from the proposal - [here](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import#example)

## [BigInt](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint)
A new primitive type for integers that are larger than _2^53_.  

You can create a _BigInt_ by appending _n_ to the end of an integer or calling the constructor.
([spec example](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint#syntax))

```j
const theBiggestInt = 9007199254740991n

const alsoHuge = BigInt(9007199254740991)
// â†ª 9007199254740991n

const hugeButString = BigInt('9007199254740991')
// â†ª 9007199254740991n
```

Standard operators work on _BigInt_s same as with _Number_ (_+_, _-_, _*_, _**_, _%_).  
However, _/_ operator will round towards zero (floor): 
```j
4n / 3n == 1n
5n / 2n == 2n
```

Other facts worth knowing:
* Using Math operators, you cannot mix _BigInt_s and _Number_s - will throw a _TypeError_
* Comparisons (_<_, _>_ etc) work as expected but _BigInt_ is not strictly equal to Number (_0n === 0_ is _false_ but _0n == 0_ is _true_) 
* Conditionals behave same as with _Number_
* _BigInt_s cannot be serialized to JSON (you'll get _TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt_)
* _Math_ library operations also don't work (_Math.round(1n) // TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number_)

Spec authors only recommend using _BigInt_ 'when values greater than _2^53_ are reasonably expected and not to coerce between the two types.'

## [Promise.allSettled](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-promise-allSettled)
There's currently 2 promise combinators, _Promise.all_ and _Promise.race_

_Promise.all_ waits for all passed promises to resolve and throws (short-circuits) on rejection.
_Promise.race_ returns whichever Promise was first to resolve and throws on rejection.

And now we have a third one:  
_Promise.allSettled_ - waits for all Promises to be resolved/rejected without throwing an error and short-circuiting 

```j
Promise
.allSettled([Promise.resolve(1), Promise.reject(2)])
.then(console.log) 
// [ { status: 'fulfilled', value: 1 }, { status: 'rejected', reason: 2 }]
```

Let's look at some real world scenarios where this could be useful ([source](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-promise-allSettled#real-world-scenarios))

_Promise.all_
```j
const urls = [ /* ... */ ]
const requests = urls.map(x => fetch(x)) // Imagine some of these will fail, and some will succeed.

// Short-circuits on first rejection, all other responses are lost
try {
  await Promise.all(requests)
  console.log('All requests have completed now I can remove the loading indicator.')
} catch {
  console.log('At least one request has failed, but some of the requests still might not be finished! Oops.')
}
```

_Promise.allSettled_
```j
// We know all API calls have finished. We use finally but allSettled will never reject.
Promise
.allSettled(requests)
.then(() => {
  console.log('All requests are completed: either failed or succeeded, I donâ€™t care')
  removeLoadingIndicator()
})
```

## [globalThis](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-global)
Due to there being different implementations of global object (_window_ in browsers, _global_ in Node, could also be _this_ )
_globalThis_ was introduced. Allows a unified access to top-level _this_ object

Before, the way to get the global object was:
```j
var getGlobal = function () {
  // the only reliable means to get the global object is
  // `Function('return this')()`
  // However, this causes CSP violations in Chrome apps.
  if (typeof self !== 'undefined') { return self }
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { return window }
  if (typeof global !== 'undefined') { return global }
	throw new Error('unable to locate global object')
}
```

Now it is possible to use `globalThis` to achieve the same result (instead of relying on platform specific global object definitions).

## [for-in mechanics](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-for-in-order)
for in iteration order was totally unspecified. However, there was already some consistency in how JS engines implemented the algo.
Now it's in the spec so for-in mechanics should have less surprises


## [Optional Chaining](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining)
In the land of JavaScript we sometimes have to work with objects that have deep nested structure.
In some of those cases we cannot be sure that some intermediate property or method exists, so we have to do some checks using conditionals
```j
let hatSize = user.wardrobe 
  && user.wardrobe.hat 
  && user.wardrobe.hat.size
```

Or something that comes from the DOM
```j
let input = querySelector('.money-input')
let money = input ? input.value : undefined
```

Optional Chaining was introduced to make it easier for developers to work with cases like this. 
```j
let hatSize = user.wardrobe?.hat?.size
let money = querySelector('.money-input')?.value
```

Also, can be used with objects methods i.e.
```j
someForm.checkValidity?.() // will call if method exists; otherwise will return undefined
```

Optional Chaining operator is looks like _?._ and can appear in these three cases:
```j
obj?.prop       // optional static property access
obj?.[expr]     // optional dynamic property access
func?.(...args) // optional function or method call
```

Worth noting that this operator is short-circuiting, so if the property or method doesn't exists - [it will not evaluate further](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining#long-short-circuiting)
```j
a?.b.c(++x).d  
// if `a` is null/undefined, evaluates to undefined.
// variable `x` is not incremented.
// otherwise, evaluates to `a.b.c(++x).d`.
```

We can also have optional deletion
```j
delete a?.b
// Same as 
a == null ? true : delete a.b
```

Optional chaining combines really well with the _Nullish colaescing operator_ which we will discuss next:

## [Nullish coalescing operator](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-nullish-coalescing)
Sometimes, we need to set a default value in case some property is _null_ or _undefined_.
Usually we achieve this by doing something like _book.title || 'No-name book'_. This works well but there might be some cases where falsy values cause unintended consequences.
Take these as an example ([from the proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-nullish-coalescing#overview-and-motivation)):
```j
const headerText = settings.headerText || 'Hello, world!' 
// ^ Potentially unintended. '' is falsy, result: 'Hello, world!'
const animationDuration = settings.animationDuration || 300 
// ^ Potentially unintended. 0 is falsy, result: 300
const showSplashScreen = settings.showSplashScreen || true 
// ^ Potentially unintended. false is falsy, result: true
```

To handle the cases where we only want to check for null or undefined values a new operator was introduced.
It's called _null coalescing operator_ and it looks like this  - _??_.

How does it work? Well, if left-hand side of the operator evaluates to _null_ or _undefined_ - the right-hand side is returned.
But if left-hand side evaluates to any other falsy value - it gets returned instead.

```j
undefined ?? 'cat' // 'cat'
null ?? 'dog' // 'dog'

'' ?? 'Hello, world!' // ''
0 ?? 300 // 0
false ?? true // false
```

This proposal is also plays really well with optional chaining operator above, so we can do fun things like:
```j
let settings = {}

let animationDuration = settings.animation?.duration ?? 100 

console.log(animationDuration) // 100
```

## [import.meta](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-meta)
This proposal gives us a way to get some meta information about current module.

_import.meta_ is an object property with _null_ prototype. 
The idea is for host environment (i.e. browser, Node, etc) to populate it with meta properties of a module.

Could be used in the browser with module loaded via script tag (passing url and data-size inside module):
```html
<script 
  type="module" 
  src="path/to/app.js" 
  data-height="500"
  data-width="350"
>
  // Notice the `data-height` and `data-width` attribute
</script>
```
And then in app.js:
```j
  let response = await fetch("/cat.jpg")
  
  let blob = await response.blob()
  let {width, height} = import.meta.scriptElement.dataset

  let image = new Image()
  image.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
  image.width = width
  image.height = height

  document.body.appendChild(image)
```

In this slightly modified example [from the proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-meta#example) we get some cat picture and create a new image using the width and height propertie defined on the script element. We get those properties from `data-` attributes that are available on the `import.meta` object.

Overall, this could be a useful way to get some meta data about any module. Personally, I can't wait to see what useful info JavaScript platforms will make available to us with this proposal.

***

To sum it up, we got some good improvements to the JavaScript language this summer. With things like nullish-coalescing operator, optional chaining, _Promise.allSettled_ - we now have even more tools to make great things happen.

Huge thank you to all members of TC39 committee for their hard work to make these proposals part of the spec.
